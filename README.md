# Move-Review-Sentiment-Calculator
User-generated reviews given a score of 1-5 based on previous data

Felix Diaz, partner: Kyle Russell
Program reads in a list of short movie reviews associated with a rating from 1-5
hashes them as a "word entry" object into a table with a rating based on the frequency of
the word as well as its overall sentiment as given by the rating. Program will use this
information to generate a rough evaluation of a user-generate review, based on the 
wordage of their review.
	
note: program will take a minute or two to read in 
all the information from the movieReviews file
will prompt user for a review of their own when ready
